Increased Hit/Miss ratio:
0,1,0,1,0,1...
This is a recurring sequences. The program will use pages already created before.
The first few(N) pages will be created for the first time and they will have misses,
but with the repetitions will be only hits.

Decreased:
0,1,2,3,4,5... 
This is a sequence without any repetition. Here will be only misses,
because program will not use already created page, it will create 
new page each time.
